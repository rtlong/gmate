# GMate - Gedit 3

### *NOTE*: I'm updating some of the scripts and plugins for use with GNOME 3.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

This package contains some gedit improvements to make it more similar to
TextMate. The package contain code snippets, plugins, and an automatic
registration of rails-related files.

If you have issues with one of the plugins included in Gmate or have suggestions
please fill an issue in <http://github.com/gmate/gmate/issues>

## Install

### Ubuntu
>>>>>>> f9db4b85e7eccafd5fc4b645ec99791134b755c2

**Due GSettings need of complied schemas, there's no easy way to provide plugin configuration right now. The GNOME devs are looking into this.** See <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649717> for more info.

Migrated right now (without support for settings):

* FuzzyOpen (using GeditMessageBus to connect to filebrowser)
* Rails File Loader
* Zencoding
* Smart Indent
* Find In Files
* Text Tools (need some reword on accels to not conflict with multiedit)

Removed plugins:

* Gemini: there's a oficial plugin named Brack Completion that does the job. In ArchLinux it's available on the gedit-plugins package
* Word completion: Same as above
* Multiedit: same as above
